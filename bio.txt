Hello! My name is Charlotte, I am a bit nervous for this bootcamp but
I hope that we're all able to do well and land jobs in the end!

I live in Irvine and I spend a lot of my time playing games
and watching anime. I have a little bit of experience with coding
but I am not super confident with it yet, hopefully I can build some
solid experience over the next few months!
