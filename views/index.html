    <p>Hello! My name is Charlotte, I am a bit nervous for this bootcamp but
        I hope that we're all able to do well and land jobs in the end!
    </p>
    <p>   
        I live in Irvine and I spend a lot of my time playing games
        and watching anime. I have a little bit of experience with coding
        but I am not super confident with it yet, hopefully I can build some
        solid experience over the next few months!      
    </p>
